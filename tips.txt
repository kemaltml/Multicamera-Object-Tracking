let the package be like:

physics
|_ __init__.py 
|_ angular.momentum.py 
|_ forces.py 
|_ gravity.py 
main.py 

NUMBER 1
Use modules and packages 

"__init__.py" makes the "physics" directory a package. So you can import in the "main.py" like:

```python
import physics
```

When you run the "main.py" it will automatically runs one time the imported packages "__init__.py" file.

init: initialize

if you do this in "__init__.py"
```python 
from .forces import Forces 
# forces is the file name and Forces is the class name 
```

you can use in the "main.py" like this 
```python
from physics import Forces
```

NUMBER 2
One Class = One File 

name like this:
class file name = class_file_name.py 
class name = ClassName
