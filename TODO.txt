[x] CALCULATE ANGLE (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gISSSbYUZag&list=PLunhqkrRNRhYAffV8JDiFOatQXuU-NnxT&index=24)
    [x] Check if there is a orange color
    [x] Detect object by color with opencv
    [x] Find midpoint of the object in pixel coordinate 
    [x] Find angle of the object
        [x] For z: Multiply Hfov with midpoint of the object
        [x] For x: Multiply Vfov with midpoint of the object
    [-] Find distance with known radius
    [x] Do this for all cameras

[x] CALCULATE DISTANCE
    [x] |AB|/sin(c) = |AC|sin(b) = |BC|/sin(a) Use this and find the distances of object by cameras 
        [x] Find xy distance 
        [x] Find z altitude with sinus theorem
        [x] Find 3D vector from cam to object with vector = math.sqrt(z**2 + distance_xy^2)
    [-] may be recursively 
    
[x] CALCULATE COORDINATE
    [x] Now you have angle and distance of all cameras.
    [x] distance = [(y1-y)^2 + (x1-x)^2]^1/2 You will get equations up to number of cameras.
        find x and y from vectors_xy and then find z with x and y coordinates
    [x] You have to calculate x and y by equations. 
        [-] You can use matrix multiplication
