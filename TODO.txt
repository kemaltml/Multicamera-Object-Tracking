- CALCULATE ANGLE (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gISSSbYUZag&list=PLunhqkrRNRhYAffV8JDiFOatQXuU-NnxT&index=24)
    - Detect object by color with opencv
    - Find midpoint of the object in pixel coordinate 
    - Find x and z angles of the object
        - For x: Multiply Hfov with midpoint of the object
        - For z: Multiply Vfov with midpoint of the object
    - Do this for all cameras

- CALCULATE DISTANCE
    - |AB|/sin(c) = |AC|sin(b) = |BC|/sin(a) Use this and find the distances of object by cameras 
- CALCULATE COORDINATE
    - Now you have angle and distance of all cameras.
    - distance = [(y1-y)^2 + (x1-x)^2]^1/2 You will get equations up to number of cameras.
    - You have to calculate x and y by equations. 
        - You can use matrix multiplication
- COMPARE COORDINATES
